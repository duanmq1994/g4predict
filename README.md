<img src="./g4folding.gif" width="200">

Requirements:

* Linux (program calls sort behind the scenes)
* Python 3.5 (have not tested with Python 2.7 but it probably won't work!)
* regex>=2016.3.2

these should be installed automatically by setuptools

TO INSTALL:

    tar xf g4predict.tar.gz
    cd g4predict
    python setup.py build
