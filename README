g4predict

Predict putative G Quadruplexes using an extension of the Quadparser method

Requirements:

Linux (program calls sort behind the scenes)
Python 3* (have not tested with Python 2.7 but it probably won't work!)

It also requires these python modules:
regex>=2016.3.2

these should be installed automatically by setuptools

TO INSTALL:

I recommend using the conda package manager, it is really useful.
I have also only tested installing the scripts using conda...

Once you have conda installed, create a new environment by typing the following:

    conda create -n <name-of-environment> python=3.5
    source activate <name-of-environment>

Now download the g4predict archive, then run:

    tar xf g4predict.tar.gz
    cd g4predict
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

then to load the conda environment in future simply type:

    source activate <name-of-environment>

tested on:

Scientific Linux release 6.8 (Carbon)
Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (Xenial Xerus)

(both using conda)
